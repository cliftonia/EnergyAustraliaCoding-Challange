# Energy Australia Coding CHallange

## How to run the code

Here is the link:

## App features:

- displaying of the data through the web as well as well as the console
- Sorted Alphabetically

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- AJAX
- jQuery

## Approach

when approaching this challange I decided to use AJAX via jQuery to handle the api Request. I stored and sorted the data as requested into an Object.

I then displayed the created object through the console and then finally on the website.

## Challenges & lessons learnt

- the biggest challange that I faced is displaying multiple bands under the one record label. I have gotten it to work through the console I am finding it challanging to have it do the same on the web.

- I also noticed that the API's response was coming back sometimes with errors so I handled this by refreshing the page until the information was displayed. With 429 throttling error I created an alert to the user mentioning that the page will be refreshed

## Still to do...

- Fix the issue with the recordlable so instead of seeing the record label multiple times I just have the record label mentioned once will all the band information underneath
